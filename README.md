# Montamo Price Calendar

A responsive price calendar application for Montamo's heat pump installations, similar to Skyscanner's flight price calendar.

## Features

- Simple landing page with responsive design
- Mobile-ready interface
- Customer information display
- Monthly calendar view with color-coded weeks showing pricing
- Price calculation based on base price and percentage modifiers
- URL parameter support for customer data and base price

## URL Parameters

The application accepts the following URL parameters:

- `basePrice`: The base price for the heat pump (default: 10000)
- `customerName`: The name of the customer
- `dealId`: The ID of the deal/offer
- `location`: The location of the installation

Example URL:
```
http://localhost:3000/?basePrice=12500&customerName=Max%20Mustermann&dealId=WP-2023-001&location=MÃ¼nchen
```

## Calendar Design

The calendar displays a monthly view where:
- Each day is color-coded based on its calendar week
- Green weeks indicate lower prices
- Yellow weeks indicate standard prices
- Red weeks indicate higher prices (peak season)
- Gray weeks are disabled/unavailable
- The first day of each week shows the week number (KW) and the price for that week

## Price Matrix

The price matrix is currently defined in a JSON file (`public/price-matrix.json`). In the future, this will be fetched from an API.

The matrix contains:
- Percentage modifiers for each calendar week
- Status indicators (success, warning, danger)
- List of disabled weeks

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
